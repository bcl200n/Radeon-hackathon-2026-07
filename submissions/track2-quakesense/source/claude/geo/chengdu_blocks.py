"""Road-enclosed block (街区) extraction and population disaggregation.

This module turns an OpenStreetMap road extract into a *planar partition* of
road-enclosed blocks, which is the spatial unit requested for the Chengdu
block-scale evacuation experiments.

Why planar faces instead of a raster grid
-----------------------------------------
A 25 m or 1 km grid cell has no relationship to the built form: a cell can
straddle a river, a ring road and three residential compounds.  A road-enclosed
block is the unit that actually constrains pedestrian evacuation — residents
leave a block through a bounded number of edges onto the street network, and
those edges are where queuing happens.  Blocks therefore give us a physically
meaningful place to put departure curves, egress capacity and intra-block
walking time, which a grid cannot.

Method
------
1.  Node the road LineStrings on shared coordinates (OSM extracts are already
    noded at junctions, so exact coordinate matching at 1e-7 deg is sufficient;
    see ``PRECISION``).
2.  Build an undirected planar graph and iteratively prune degree-1 nodes
    (cul-de-sacs and dangling stubs bound no face).
3.  Extract faces by half-edge traversal: from directed edge (u, v), the next
    half-edge is (v, w) where w is the clockwise predecessor of u in the
    angular order around v.  This yields counter-clockwise interior faces and
    clockwise outer boundaries.
4.  Filter faces by area to drop slivers (dual carriageway gores, roundabout
    islands) and the outer/unbounded faces.

Known limitations (do not present these as solved)
--------------------------------------------------
* **Grade separation.** OSM motorways on bridges/tunnels do not share nodes
  with the surface street they cross, so an elevated expressway does not split
  the block beneath it.  Pass ``drop_highways`` to exclude grade-separated
  classes when that matters, or accept the merged block.
* **Extract clipping.** Roads clipped at the download bounding box create
  artificial open faces at the edge; these appear as very large faces and are
  removed by ``max_area_m2``.
* **Not a cadastral or planning boundary.** These are road-enclosed
  morphological blocks, not 街道/社区 administrative units. Do not label output
  as an official 街区 division.

The module has no third-party dependency beyond an optional numpy import, so
it runs on the cloud server and in CI without geopandas/shapely.
