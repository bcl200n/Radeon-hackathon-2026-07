"""P1 + P2 + P3 step loop for the full-population swarm, on GPU.

Implements, over one agent per resident:

* (1) departure, lognormal per agent
* (2) crowd field, weighted bincount, no host sync
* (3) belief diffusion across the real block adjacency
* (4) logit destination choice over K candidates -- what splits the flow
* (5) advance along one adjacency edge at a time
* (6) helper matching, block-level supply and demand
* (7) shelter admission by segmented prefix sum -- the one serial point
* (8) give-up on fatigue
* (9) event stream, flushed to disk by a CPU thread off the critical path

Agents now traverse intermediate blocks and feel the congestion in each one,
which is what the straight-line version of P1 could not do.

Still not implemented: the LLM leader tier (see llm_leaders.py, wired in
separately), and per-agent social groups -- group_id/helper_id are allocated
and helper matching is aggregate rather than pairwise.
