"""The LLM-driven leader tier.

Chengdu's emergency management is tiered: ~20 districts, ~330 subdistricts,
~3,200 communities, and a grid-management layer below. Everything from the
subdistrict up -- 350 people -- reasons with the local language model instead
of a fixed rule. The rest are still leaders; they just follow the rule policy.

What a leader does is not move differently. A leader changes the *beliefs* of
the blocks in their jurisdiction, which is how one person redirects thousands
without any central scheduler. That matters for the argument the paper makes:
under loss of power, water and network, guidance has to be local and
distributed, not top-down.

Concurrency is the whole cost story. One decision measured 1.106 s on this
Radeon; 350 leaders x 18 rounds is 6,300 calls, which is 1.94 h serial. The
llama.cpp server is run with 32 slots and continuous batching, and this module
keeps all of them busy with a thread pool -- threads, not processes, because
the GIL is released across the socket read.
