"""Real block adjacency from shared polygon edges.

Two road-enclosed blocks are neighbours if they share a boundary segment, not
if their centroids happen to be close. A k-nearest-centroid graph would let
people step across a river or a rail corridor, which is exactly the error the
resistance surface exists to prevent.

The construction is fully vectorised: quantise every vertex to an integer id,
emit one (u, v) pair per polygon edge, sort each pair, and group identical
pairs. An edge shared by exactly two polygons is an adjacency.
