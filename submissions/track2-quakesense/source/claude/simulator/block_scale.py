"""Block-scale (街区尺度) evacuation engine.

Design rationale
----------------
The existing ``simulator.multiscale`` meso layer moves population between
~1 km grid cells using a distance-weighted diffusion rule.  That rule has no
capacity anywhere in it: the same fraction of a cell leaves per step whether
the cell is a single tower block with two gates or an open park.  Evacuation
times produced that way are a function of the diffusion constant, not of the
city.

This module replaces that with a **capacity-constrained queueing network on
road-enclosed blocks**, which is the smallest unit where the physics are real:

* People inside a block must reach the block boundary.  Intra-block walk time
  scales with the block's area-equivalent radius.
* They then pass through the block's egress onto the street.  Throughput there
  is bounded by ``egress width x specific flow`` (Fruin / Weidmann pedestrian
  fundamental diagram, ~1.2-1.4 persons per metre per second at capacity).
* They walk block-to-block along a routing tree toward a shelter.  Each hop is
  bounded by the shared boundary's width, so congestion emerges from geometry
  rather than from a tuned constant.
* Shelters admit until capacity, then overflow reroutes to the next reachable
  shelter.

Scaling
-------
Population is carried as **continuous stocks in numpy arrays of length
n_blocks**, not as one Python object per person.  A 50万-1,000,000 person
scenario over ~28,000 Chengdu blocks is therefore a few hundred float64
arrays, and a 2-hour simulation at 30 s steps is 240 vectorised steps.
Individual agents are materialised only for the rendered sample and for the
LLM coordinator cohort, which is where per-agent detail is actually observed.

Nothing here is calibrated against an observed Chengdu evacuation, because no
such observation exists.  Departure curves, participation rates and specific
flow are documented assumptions with literature-sourced defaults; they are
reported in the output payload so a reader can see what was assumed.
